                    <h3>What is Forex, and how does it work?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">The Forex (foreign exchange) market is the global currency exchange network. Trading involves buying one currency and selling another to profit from price differences. Major pairs include EUR/USD, GBP/JPY, and others.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <h3>What risks are involved in Forex trading?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">Forex is highly volatile, with prices fluctuating in real time. Key risks include exchange rate fluctuations, economic events, and leverage, which can amplify both gains and losses.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <h3>How to choose currency pairs for trading?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">Market newcomers should start with major pairs like EUR/USD or GBP/USD, as they are less volatile and have more predictable trends. Your choice should align with your trading strategy and market conditions.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <h3>What is leverage, and how does it work?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">Leverage allows traders to open larger positions with a smaller deposit. For example, with 1:100 leverage, you control $10,000 with just $100. While it increases profit potential, it also raises risks.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <h3>How to start Forex trading with minimal risk?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">To reduce risks, start with small positions, use stop-loss orders, study market trends, and stay updated with news. Develop a solid strategy and stick to it.</p>
